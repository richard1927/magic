# magic and FizzBuzz (& dragons?)
This was made during code social on 9/6/2019, where funky stuff happened. 
Lots of manly men, lots of beer, snacks and strange things crawling around.

The goal was to make FizzBuz without using logical operators such as for, if or switch. The files contained here are the results of our
labour. You have the pleasure of viewing this treasure. Enjoy!!

(Pull requests are most welcome!!)
